            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                The Titanic Survival Predictor is a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a passenger's survival based on various factors such as age, gender, and ticket class. This project demonstrates the power of data science in analyzing historical events and drawing meaningful insights.

            <div class="journey-steps">
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 1: Gathering the Passenger Manifest</h3>
                    <p>Started with a list of passengers and their information, like age, gender, and ticket class.</p>
                    <p><em>Analogy: Imagine you're the ship's captain, collecting boarding passes as passengers embark.</em></p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Cleaning Up  Passenger List</h3>
                    <p>Making sure  list is complete and accurate, filling in any missing information.</p>
                    <p><em>Analogy: It's like making sure everyone's name is spelled correctly on the guest list for a big party.</em></p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 3: Dividing Passengers into Groups</h3>
                    <p>Spliting passenger list into two groups: one for training  prediction model, and one for testing it.</p>
                    <p><em>Analogy: Think of it as dividing a deck of cards into two piles: one to practice card tricks with, and one to perform the tricks for an audience.</em></p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 4: Teaching  Model</h3>
                    <p>Using the training group to teach  model how different factors affected survival rates.</p>
                    <p><em>Analogy: It's like teaching a new crew member how to spot which passengers might need extra help in an emergency.</em></p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 5: Testing  Model</h3>
                    <p>We use the testing group to see how well  model predicts survival, comparing its predictions to what actually happened.</p>
                    <p><em>Analogy: Imagine running a lifeboat drill with the passengers we set aside, seeing if  crew member correctly identifies who needs help.</em></p>
                </div>
                <div class="step">
                    <h3>Step 6: Improving  Model</h3>
                    <p>Based on how well  model performed, we make adjustments to improve its accuracy.</p>
                    <p><em>Analogy: It's like fine-tuning  emergency procedures after the drill, making sure we're as prepared as possible for the real thing.</em></p>

            <h2>The Model</h2>
            <p>
                We used logistic regression to build  prediction model. The process involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training. Here are some visualizations of  data and model:

                    <p>This heatmap shows the correlation between different features in  dataset. Darker colors indicate stronger correlations, helping us identify which factors might be most important for predicting survival.</p>

                    <p>These subplots show the distribution of various features in  dataset, separated by survival outcome. They help us visualize how different factors might influence a passenger's chances of survival.</p>

                    <p>The confusion matrix shows how well  model predicts survival and non-survival. It helps us understand the model's accuracy, including false positives and false negatives.</p>

                    <p>The learning curve shows how  model's performance improves as it's trained on more data. It helps us determine if we need more training data or if  model is overfitting.</p>

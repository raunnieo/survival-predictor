## About the Project
The Titanic Survival Predictor is a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on different features such as age, gender, and ticket class.

The project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Logistic regression for survival prediction.
- Visualization of the correlation and survival analysis.

Visualizations include:
- **Correlation Heatmap**: To identify the most impactful features.
- **Feature Distribution**: To analyze how different features relate to survival.

Visual results include:
- **Confusion Matrix**: Understanding prediction errors.
- **Learning Curve**: Showing model improvement over time.<br>
